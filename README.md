# LNM Daily
## A platform to connect all the University Residents
---
### Premise
A university is a very happening place. There are hundreds of events held every year. Currently, e-mails are the primary means to inform the residents about any new event. There are many problems with this form of communication. Mails are often thought of as spam and ignored by the majority of the receivers. Therefore, especially when it comes to introverts miss such events even if they are interested in the event due to lack of exposure. Furthermore, these even lead to less interaction, and hence people miss out on meeting with like-minded people for the entirety of their stay at the campus.

### Purpose
LNM Daily's purpose is two-fold. 
1. Firstly, it aims to provide a platform for all residents at a university, using which they can stay updated with the day-to-day events and activities held in the university.
2. Secondly, it gives a mechanism in which people living on campus can connect with like-minded people using an online chat subsystem.

### Idea Overview
The primary features of our website are:-

###### 1. Constantly updating feed for new announcements of new events.
###### 2. Information on the clubs and groups that are active in the university.
###### 3. Chat sub-system to connect with like-minded people.
###### 4. Ability to register for events directly through the website.
###### 5. Ability to create events individually after creating an account on the website.
###### 6. Recieving personalised feed based on the user's likes and interests
